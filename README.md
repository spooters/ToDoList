# ToDoList
A PowerShell to do list

In an effort to learn PowerShell I plan to write a To do list manager using PowerShell.  Understandably it will start out very basic.  As I learn more I hope that it becomes more advanced. 

These are my starting requirements.  

- Store TODO items in a file.
- ADD TODO, REMOVE TODO, SHOW TODO
- Assign ID, Priority, Tags, Description 

  When I have completed these objectives I will look to add functionality.
